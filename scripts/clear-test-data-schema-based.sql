-- FINAL TEST DATA CLEANUP - Based on actual database schema
-- =====================================================================================
-- Clears all test orders, referrals, and commission data
-- Only operates on tables that exist in complete_schema.sql

-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 1: Show current data counts before cleanup
-- =============================================================================

-- =============================================================================

-- Clear commission payments (references partners, but not orders)

-- Clear order items (references orders)
DELETE FROM order_items;

-- Clear client orders (references referrals and partners)

-- Clear orders (main order records)
DELETE FROM orders;

-- Clear referrals (partner referral data)
DELETE FROM referrals;

-- Clear cart items (active shopping carts)
DELETE FROM cart_items;

-- Clear purchase-related user interactions (keep likes, shares, views)
-- Note: 'purchase' is not in the schema constraint, but clear if any exist
