## ðŸš€ Ready to Execute Database Setup

**You can now run the database scripts in Supabase:**

1. **First**: Execute `extended-referral-system-migration.sql`
2. **Second**: Execute `extended-referral-functions.sql`
3. **Third**: Execute `extended-referral-rls-policies.sql`

After successful database setup, the application layer implementation can begin immediately with full backend support ready.

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics Dashboard (Future)

Once implemented, track these key metrics:

### Partner Acquisition Funnel:
- QR codes distributed â†’ Scanned â†’ Partners signed up â†’ Approved â†’ Active

### Customer Referral Funnel:
- Referrals sent â†’ Friends visited â†’ Friends signed up â†’ Friends purchased â†’ Credits awarded

### Financial Impact:
- Cash investment (partner channel) vs. Zero-cost growth (customer channel)
- Customer Lifetime Value by acquisition source
- Commission payouts vs. Credit rewards issued
