-- COMPREHENSIVE TEST DATA CLEANUP - Clear all test orders, referrals, and commissions
-- =====================================================================================
-- This script removes all test data while preserving system configuration data

-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 1: Show current data counts before cleanup
-- =============================================================================

-- STEP 2: Create backup tables (optional - uncomment if you want backups)
-- =============================================================================
-- CREATE TABLE backup_orders_$(date +%Y%m%d) AS SELECT * FROM orders;

-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 3: Clear all test data (order matters due to foreign key constraints)
-- =============================================================================

-- Clear cost tracking data first (references order_items)
DELETE FROM cost_snapshots WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'cost_snapshots');

-- Clear Gelato webhook logs
DELETE FROM gelato_webhooks WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'gelato_webhooks');

-- Clear order items (references orders)
DELETE FROM order_items;

-- Clear commission tracking (references orders via order_id or referrals)  
DELETE FROM client_orders;

-- Clear referral analytics (references referrals)
DELETE FROM referral_analytics;

-- Clear all orders (main transaction records)
DELETE FROM orders;

-- Clear all referrals (partner tracking data)
DELETE FROM referrals;

-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 4: Reset any auto-incrementing sequences if they exist
-- =============================================================================
-- Note: Most tables use UUIDs, but reset any sequences that might exist

-- Reset order number sequence if it exists
DO $$

    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.sequences WHERE sequence_name LIKE '%order%') THEN
        -- This would reset order number generation, but we use timestamps so not needed

-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 5: Clear any cached/derived data
-- =============================================================================

-- Clear user interactions related to purchases (keep likes/shares for engagement)
DELETE FROM user_interactions WHERE interaction_type = 'purchase';

-- Clear any QR code tracking data from referrals
DELETE FROM qr_code_tracking WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'qr_code_tracking');

-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 6: Show final counts to verify cleanup
