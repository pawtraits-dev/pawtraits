# Information Security Principles - Pawtraits Platform

## I. Core Security Philosophy

- [ ] **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify - validate all requests regardless of source
- [ ] **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls across all system components
- [ ] **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and systems have minimal access required for their function
- [ ] **Security by Design**: Security considerations integrated from the beginning, not bolted on
- [ ] **Data Minimization**: Collect, store, and process only necessary personal and business data
- [ ] **Fail Secure**: System failures should default to secure states, denying rather than allowing access
- [ ] **Transparency & Auditability**: All security-relevant actions must be logged and auditable
