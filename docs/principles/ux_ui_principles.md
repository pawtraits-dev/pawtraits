## II. Design System Foundation

### Color Strategy (Aligned with Pawtraits Brand Colors)
- [ ] **Brand Color Psychology**: 
  - `primary` (#6B46C1): Rich purple conveys **trust, premium quality, and creativity** - perfect for pet services
  - `secondary` (#F69E0B): Vibrant orange evokes **energy, warmth, and playfulness** - captures pet joy
  - `tertiary` (#94CA42): Fresh green represents **nature, health, and growth** - ideal for pet wellness
- [ ] **Emotional Design Application**:
  - Purple primary: Trust-building for payment flows, premium portrait positioning
  - Orange secondary: Call-to-action buttons, celebration moments, energy states
  - Green tertiary: Success states, health indicators, positive reinforcement
- [ ] **CSS Custom Properties**: Use HSL values with CSS variables for seamless theme switching
- [ ] **Dark Mode Implementation**: Complete dark/light theme system via `class` strategy with brand color integrity
- [ ] **Accessibility Compliance**: All brand color combinations meet WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1)
- [ ] **Multi-Tenant Variations**: Purple variations for different user contexts:
  - Customer theme: Lighter purple (65% lightness) for emotional warmth
  - Partner theme: Medium purple (45% lightness) for professional trust
  - Admin theme: Darker purple (35% lightness) for authority and control

### Typography Hierarchy (Required Tailwind Config Extensions)
- [ ] **Font Family**: Define `fontFamily` with pet-friendly sans-serif stack:
  ```js
  fontFamily: {
    sans: ['Inter', 'system-ui', '-apple-system', 'sans-serif'],
    display: ['Manrope', 'Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'] // For headers
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Font Size Scale**: Define complete `fontSize` scale:
  ```js
  fontSize: {
    xs: ['12px', { lineHeight: '16px' }],    // Captions, metadata
    sm: ['14px', { lineHeight: '20px' }],    // Small text, labels  
    base: ['16px', { lineHeight: '24px' }],  // Body text default
    lg: ['18px', { lineHeight: '28px' }],    // Large body, component titles
    xl: ['20px', { lineHeight: '28px' }],    // Subsection headers
    '2xl': ['24px', { lineHeight: '32px' }], // Section headers
    '3xl': ['32px', { lineHeight: '40px' }], // Page titles
    '4xl': ['40px', { lineHeight: '48px' }]  // Hero titles
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Font Weight Strategy**: Extend `fontWeight`:
  ```js
  fontWeight: {
    normal: '400',    // Regular body text
    medium: '500',    // Emphasized text, labels
    semibold: '600',  // Subheadings, important UI text
    bold: '700'       // Headers, primary CTAs
  }
  ```

### Spacing and Layout (8px Grid System)
- [ ] **8px Base Unit**: Extend Tailwind's spacing scale with pet-friendly names:
  ```js
  spacing: {
    'paw': '4px',     // 0.5 * base - minimal spacing
    'treat': '8px',   // 1 * base - small spacing  
    'toy': '12px',    // 1.5 * base - medium-small spacing
    'collar': '16px', // 2 * base - standard spacing
    'leash': '24px',  // 3 * base - large spacing
    'yard': '32px',   // 4 * base - extra large spacing
    'park': '48px',   // 6 * base - section spacing
    'field': '64px'   // 8 * base - page-level spacing
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Responsive Spacing**: All spacing values should scale appropriately on mobile
- [ ] **Golden Ratio Proportions**: Use 1.618 ratio for pleasing visual proportions in layouts
- [ ] **Consistent Alignment**: Left-align text, right-align numbers, center special content
- [ ] **Generous White Space**: Ample breathing room to reduce cognitive load

### Component Library Implementation
- [ ] **Tailwind-Based Components**: Consistent use of design tokens across all components
- [ ] **State-Aware Components**: Implement all interactive states using design system utilities:
  ```jsx
  // Example button with proper design token usage
  <button className="bg-primary hover:bg-primary/90 focus:ring-ring text-primary-foreground 
                     px-collar py-treat rounded-treat font-medium
                     transition-colors duration-150 ease-out
                     focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2">
  ```
- [ ] **Pet-Themed Component Variants Using Brand Colors**:
  - Primary buttons: `bg-primary text-primary-foreground` (main CTAs - purple for trust)
  - Secondary buttons: `bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground` (energetic actions - orange for warmth)
  - Success buttons: `bg-tertiary text-tertiary-foreground` (positive actions - green for health)
  - Destructive buttons: `bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground` (delete actions)
  - Ghost buttons: `hover:bg-muted text-foreground` (minimal actions)
- [ ] **Brand Color Usage Patterns**:
  ```jsx
  // Primary CTA (trust & conversion)
  <button className="bg-primary hover:bg-primary/90 text-primary-foreground">
    Generate Portrait
  </button>
  
  // Secondary action (energy & engagement)  
  <button className="bg-secondary hover:bg-secondary/90 text-secondary-foreground">
    Upload Photos
  </button>
  
  // Success feedback (health & nature)
  <div className="bg-tertiary/10 border border-tertiary text-tertiary-foreground">
    Order completed successfully!
  </div>
  ```
- [ ] **Form Component Excellence**: Use consistent spacing and color tokens:
  ```jsx
  <input className="border-input bg-background text-foreground 
                    px-collar py-treat rounded-treat
                    focus:border-ring focus:ring-ring" />
  ```
- [ ] **Card-Based Information Architecture**: Consistent card patterns using design tokens:
  ```jsx
  <div className="bg-card text-card-foreground border border-border 
                  rounded-toy p-leash shadow-treat">
  ```
