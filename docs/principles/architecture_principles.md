# Architecture Principles - Pawtraits Platform

## I. Core Architecture Philosophy

- [ ] **API-First Design**: Every feature should expose consistent RESTful APIs with proper versioning and documentation
- [ ] **Type Safety First**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage across all layers (frontend, backend, database schemas)
- [ ] **Scalable Multi-Tenancy**: Role-based architecture supporting Admin, Partner, and Customer user types with clear data isolation
- [ ] **Event-Driven Patterns**: Use of webhooks and event-driven architecture for external integrations (Stripe, Gelato)
- [ ] **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between presentation, business logic, and data layers
- [ ] **Microservice-Ready**: Modular design allowing future extraction of services without major refactoring
- [ ] **Database-First Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) and database-enforced constraints as primary security layer

## II. Next.js App Router Architecture

### Route Organization
- [ ] **Consistent Route Structure**: 
  - `/admin/*` - Admin-only routes with service role access
  - `/partners/*` - Partner dashboard and tools
  - `/api/*` - API endpoints with consistent error handling
  - `/[referralCode]` - Customer journey routes
- [ ] **Layout Hierarchy**: Proper layout nesting for shared UI components and authentication guards
- [ ] **Loading States**: Implement loading.tsx for all route segments
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: error.tsx files for graceful error handling at each route level
- [ ] **Metadata Management**: Dynamic metadata generation for SEO and social sharing

### Server Components Strategy
- [ ] **Server-First Rendering**: Default to Server Components, use Client Components only when necessary
- [ ] **Data Fetching Patterns**: Server Components for initial data, Client Components for interactive states
- [ ] **Streaming**: Implement Suspense boundaries for progressive page loading
- [ ] **Static Optimization**: Use generateStaticParams for SEO-critical pages

## III. Database Architecture & Patterns

### Supabase Integration
- [ ] **Comprehensive RLS Policies**: Every table must have appropriate Row Level Security policies
- [ ] **Foreign Key Integrity**: All relationships enforced at database level with proper cascading
- [ ] **Audit Trails**: created_at, updated_at, and user attribution on all tables
- [ ] **Database Functions**: Complex business logic implemented as database functions
- [ ] **Type Generation**: Automated TypeScript type generation from database schema

### Data Modeling
- [ ] **Normalized Design**: Proper 3NF normalization with strategic denormalization for performance
- [ ] **JSON Columns**: Strategic use of JSONB for flexible metadata and configuration storage
- [ ] **Indexing Strategy**: Proper indexing for all query patterns, especially RLS-enabled queries
- [ ] **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management for serverless architecture

## IV. API Design Patterns

### RESTful Conventions
- [ ] **HTTP Method Semantics**: Proper use of GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- [ ] **Status Code Standards**: Consistent HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- [ ] **Request/Response Format**: Standardized JSON request/response structures
- [ ] **Pagination**: Consistent pagination patterns for list endpoints
- [ ] **Filtering & Sorting**: Standard query parameter conventions

### Error Handling
- [ ] **Structured Error Responses**: Consistent error object format with codes and messages
- [ ] **Client Error Handling**: Proper error boundaries and user-friendly error messages
- [ ] **Logging Strategy**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback behaviors for external service failures

## V. External Integration Architecture

### Third-Party Service Integration
- [ ] **Adapter Pattern**: Wrapper services for external APIs (Stripe, Gelato, Cloudinary)
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker**: Resilience patterns for external service failures
- [ ] **Webhook Security**: Proper webhook signature validation and idempotency
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Respect external API rate limits with proper backoff strategies
- [ ] **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration for different deployment stages

### AI Integration Patterns
- [ ] **Claude SDK Integration**: Proper error handling and retry logic for AI prompt generation
- [ ] **Prompt Management**: Version-controlled prompt templates with A/B testing capability
- [ ] **AI Response Validation**: Schema validation for AI-generated content
- [ ] **Fallback Strategies**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

## VI. State Management Architecture

### Client-Side State
- [ ] **React Server State**: Use of Next.js App Router for server state management
- [ ] **Client State Patterns**: Minimal client state with strategic use of React hooks
- [ ] **Form State Management**: Consistent form handling with validation
- [ ] **Cache Management**: Proper cache invalidation strategies

### Global State
- [ ] **Context Usage**: Strategic use of React Context for truly global state
- [ ] **URL State**: Leverage URL parameters for shareable application state
- [ ] **Local Storage**: Minimal use of local storage with proper fallbacks

## VII. Performance Architecture

### Code Splitting
- [ ] **Route-Based Splitting**: Automatic code splitting at route boundaries
- [ ] **Component Lazy Loading**: Dynamic imports for large, rarely-used components
- [ ] **Bundle Analysis**: Regular bundle size monitoring and optimization

### Asset Optimization
- [ ] **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with proper sizing and formats
- [ ] **Static Asset CDN**: Proper CDN configuration for static assets
- [ ] **Font Optimization**: Efficient web font loading strategies

## VIII. Testing Architecture

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for business logic and utilities
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: API endpoint testing with real database
- [ ] **E2E Testing**: Critical user flow testing with Playwright
- [ ] **Type Testing**: TypeScript compilation as part of test suite

### Test Organization
- [ ] **Test Co-location**: Tests alongside source code where appropriate
- [ ] **Test Data Management**: Proper test data setup and teardown
- [ ] **Mock Strategies**: Strategic mocking of external services
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing in deployment pipeline

## IX. Deployment & Infrastructure

### Vercel Optimization
- [ ] **Edge Functions**: Strategic use of Edge Runtime for performance
- [ ] **Environment Management**: Proper environment variable management
- [ ] **Preview Deployments**: Effective use of preview deployments for testing
- [ ] **Analytics Integration**: Built-in performance monitoring

### Configuration Management
- [ ] **Environment Separation**: Clear separation between development, staging, and production
- [ ] **Feature Flags**: Implementation of feature toggles for gradual rollouts
- [ ] **Configuration Validation**: Runtime validation of all environment variables

## X. Code Quality & Maintainability

### Code Standards
- [ ] **ESLint Configuration**: Strict linting rules for consistency
- [ ] **Prettier Integration**: Automated code formatting
- [ ] **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Maximum type safety with strict TypeScript configuration
- [ ] **Import Organization**: Consistent import ordering and aliasing

### Documentation Standards
- [ ] **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- [ ] **Code Comments**: Strategic commenting for complex business logic
- [ ] **README Files**: Comprehensive setup and development documentation
- [ ] **Architecture Decision Records**: Documentation of significant architectural decisions

This architecture framework ensures the Pawtraits platform maintains consistency, scalability, and maintainability while supporting the complex multi-tenant business model and external integrations.
