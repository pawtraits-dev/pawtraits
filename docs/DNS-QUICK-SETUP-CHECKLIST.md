#### 1. Web Hosting (Vercel)
- [ ] **A Record** for root domain
  ```
  Type: A
  Name: @ (or blank)
  Value: [IP from Vercel, likely 76.76.21.21]
  TTL: 3600
  ```

- [ ] **CNAME** for www
  ```
  Type: CNAME
  Name: www
  Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
  TTL: 3600
  ```

- [ ] **CNAME** for staging (optional)
  ```
  Type: CNAME
  Name: staging
  Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
  TTL: 3600
  ```

#### 2. Email Receiving (cPanel)
- [ ] **MX Records** (keep existing or add if missing)
  ```
  Type: MX
  Name: @ (or blank)
  Value: [your-cpanel-mail-server]
  Priority: 10
  TTL: 3600
  ```

  **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Do NOT change existing MX records unless you know they're wrong!

#### 3. Email Sending (SPF + Resend)
- [ ] **SPF Record** (combine cPanel + Resend)
  ```
  Type: TXT
  Name: @ (or blank)
  Value: v=spf1 [your-cpanel-include] include:resend.com ~all
  TTL: 3600
  ```

  **Example**:
  ```
  v=spf1 include:_spf.mx.cloudflare.net include:resend.com ~all
  ```

  **‚ö†Ô∏è Find your cPanel include**:
  - Check current SPF: https://mxtoolbox.com/spf/pawtraits.dev
  - Copy the `include:xxxxxxx` part
  - Add Resend's include to it

- [ ] **DKIM Record** (from Resend)
  ```
  Type: TXT
  Name: resend._domainkey
  Value: [long key from Resend dashboard]
  TTL: 3600
  ```

- [ ] **DMARC Record**
  ```
  Type: TXT
  Name: _dmarc
  Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@pawtraits.pics
  TTL: 3600
  ```

### For pawtraits.dev (Development)

Repeat the same steps above with pawtraits.dev

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Make sure pawtraits.dev has correct MX records pointing to your cPanel server!

## ‚è±Ô∏è Wait for Propagation

- [ ] DNS changes made at: `_____ (date/time)`
- [ ] Wait 1-4 hours minimum
- [ ] Full propagation can take up to 48 hours

## ‚úÖ Verification (After 2-4 Hours)

### Check Web Hosting
- [ ] Visit https://pawtraits.pics (should load from Vercel)
- [ ] Visit https://www.pawtraits.pics (should work)
- [ ] Check DNS: `nslookup pawtraits.pics` (should show Vercel IP)

### Check Email Receiving
- [ ] Send test email TO: `test@pawtraits.pics` or existing address
- [ ] Email arrives in cPanel inbox?
- [ ] Check MX: https://mxtoolbox.com/mx/pawtraits.pics
- [ ] MX points to cPanel server (NOT Vercel)?

### Check Email Sending (Resend)
- [ ] Resend Dashboard ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí pawtraits.pics shows "Verified" ‚úÖ
- [ ] Send test email from Resend dashboard
- [ ] Check spam folder if not in inbox

### Check DNS Records
- [ ] SPF: https://mxtoolbox.com/spf/pawtraits.pics ‚úÖ
- [ ] DKIM: `nslookup -type=txt resend._domainkey.pawtraits.pics` ‚úÖ
- [ ] DMARC: https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc/pawtraits.pics ‚úÖ

## üîå Application Configuration

### Vercel Environment Variables
- [ ] Go to Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- [ ] Add these for ALL environments (Production, Preview, Development):

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=[from Resend dashboard]
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@pawtraits.pics
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@pawtraits.pics
```

### Redeploy Application
- [ ] Trigger a new deployment (push a commit or manual redeploy)
- [ ] Vercel needs to restart to pick up new env vars

## üß™ Application Testing

- [ ] Test order confirmation email sends
- [ ] Test password reset email sends
- [ ] Check from address shows: `noreply@pawtraits.pics`
- [ ] Check reply-to goes to: `support@pawtraits.pics`
- [ ] Email doesn't go to spam

## üö® If Something's Wrong

### Website Not Loading
1. Check Vercel A record: `nslookup pawtraits.pics`
2. Check Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Domains (should show "Valid")
3. Wait longer (DNS can take 48 hours)
4. Try Vercel preview URL to confirm app works

### Can't Receive Email
1. Check MX records: https://mxtoolbox.com/mx/pawtraits.pics
2. MX should point to cPanel server, NOT Vercel
3. Contact hosting provider to confirm MX server hostname
4. Check if email works at other addresses (to isolate issue)

### Resend Not Verifying
1. Check DKIM: `nslookup -type=txt resend._domainkey.pawtraits.pics`
2. Try adding with trailing dot: `resend._domainkey.pawtraits.pics.`
3. Wait 24 hours and click "Verify" again
4. Contact Resend support if still failing

### Emails Going to Spam
1. Verify SPF includes both: https://mxtoolbox.com/spf/pawtraits.pics
2. Check DKIM and DMARC exist
3. Send test to: https://www.mail-tester.com/
4. Wait a few days (new domains have lower reputation)
