File Format & Color Requirements
Best formats: PNG for designs with transparent backgrounds or JPEG for high-resolution images What are the design requirements for PDF uploads? | Gelato Create | Help Center
Color profile: For posters and non-paper products, it is recommended to use sRGB images to ensure the most vibrant output is achieved What are the design requirements for PDF uploads? | Gelato Create | Help Center
File size considerations: Images at 300 DPI for the largest format (60×40 cm) will be substantial (approximately 33+ million pixels), so ensure your design software can handle these dimensions efficiently.
Quality Tips

Always ensure that you select the highest resolution versions of an image you have Why is my image blurry or pixelated? | Gelato Create | Help Center
Check by zooming in on the image. If the image becomes exceedingly fuzzy, it means it's not sharp enough Why is my image blurry or pixelated? | Gelato Create | Help Center
Simply increasing the pixel count or resolution of a low-resolution image won't enhance the print quality. It's crucial to create your design from scratch at the necessary resolution GelatoGelato

For the best results across your entire size range, I'd recommend working at 300 DPI and sizing your artwork to the largest format you plan to print (60×40 cm for rectangular or 40×40 cm for square), then scaling down for smaller sizes as needed.
