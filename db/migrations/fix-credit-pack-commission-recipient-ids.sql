-- =====================================================
-- FIX CREDIT PACK COMMISSION RECIPIENT IDS
-- =====================================================
-- Purpose: Update existing credit pack bonus commission records to use
--          correct recipient_id (customers.id instead of user_profiles.id)
-- Context: Checkout was incorrectly using userProfile.id for commission records
--          Referrals API queries by customer.id, so bonuses weren't visible
-- =====================================================
